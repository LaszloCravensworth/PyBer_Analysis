# PyBer_Analysis
An analysis of PyBer ride share data

## Overview of Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CEO at Pyber requested a summary of the ride share data based on city type.  Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib I was able to create a summary dataframe and give a visual representation of the data with a multiline chart.  For the final part of the project, I delivered a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
### Resources
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Software: Python 3.9.7 64-bit, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

## Results
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Pyber data analysis revealed that supply and demand is likely the factor driving cost at Pyber.  The more densely packed the community, the more rides and drivers Pyber attracts.  This accounts for more fares to be collected from both drivers and riders alike.  The Pyber summary data frame as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After creating a data frame summary I was able to plot the analysis on a multiline chart.  I used Matplotlib to generate the chart using the object oriented approach.  Within their respects, all of the city types followed a similar ebb and flow.  Here is a visual representation of that data:

## Summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would recommend these three talking points for addressing the disparities among the city types.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)Population density, based off of city type, is a driving force in the total number of riders and drivers.  More people tend to live in a closer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proximity to each other in an urban environment.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2)Distance traveled, based off of city type, is a deciding factor in the average fare cost.  When locations are further apart, cost to get there &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increases. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3)Supply and demand plays a major role in supplying rural clients with Pyber's business.  Hence, the average fare per ride tends to be 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;higher where demand is less.
